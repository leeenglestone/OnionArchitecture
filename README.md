# OnionArchitecture
Thought i'd have a stab at creating simple sample solution for explaining Onion Architecture.

## Goal
To demonstrate multi layer, loosely coupled architecture.

## Business Scenario
A web application for a pet store.

## Requirements
- Must demonstrate ability to retrieve from at least 2 different sources thereby proving benefit of Dependency Injection.
- Each layer must only talk to its adjacent layer
- More when I think of them

## Technology Stack
- ASP.NET MVC 5
- ASP.NET Web-API (eventially)
- Ninject (Dependency Injection)
- Biggy (Data Store)
- Some other data store

## Diagram
[Eventually]
